# 🇮🇹 Questions for Claude Opus - CILS B1 Exam Prep Review

**Project**: 28-Day Italian Citizenship Exam Preparation
**Exam Date**: December 4, 2025 (28 days away)
**Current Level**: A2 (aiming for B1 pass)
**Daily Study Time**: 2 hours
**Review Focus**: Optimize 80/20 strategy for maximum exam success

---

## 🎯 TIER 1 QUESTIONS (CRITICAL - MUST ANSWER)

### Q1.1: Is 28 Days Realistically Enough?

**Context**:
- Current level: A2 (can handle basic conversations, simple written tasks)
- Target: B1 (can discuss familiar topics, write simple emails, understand main points)
- Language learning timeline: Typically 400+ hours from A2 to B1
- Available time: 2 hours/day × 28 days = 56 hours

**The Core Question**:
Can you realistically jump from A2 → B1 in 56 hours of intensive study to **pass** the CILS B1 Cittadinanza exam (not master B1, just pass)?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Is 56 hours sufficient for a "pass" (50% minimum on all 4 sections)?
2. What's the minimum viable competency per section for passing?
3. Should the timeline be realistic or is this a stretch?
4. If 28 days is too short, what's the minimum realistic timeline?

**Why It Matters**: This determines whether the entire plan is feasible or needs extension.

### Q1.2: Which Exam Section is Highest-Risk for Failure?

**Current Time Allocation** (per day):
- Grammar (38%): 46 min/day (Anki + cloze exercises)
- Writing (21%): 25 min/day (email practice)
- Speaking (18%): 22 min/day (recorded prompts)
- Reading (17%): 20 min/day (comprehension + Percorso)
- Listening (0%): No daily practice (only 3 mock tests total)

**Passing Requirements**: Must score ≥7/14 (50%) on ALL 4 sections

**The Core Question**:
Given this allocation, which section will you likely **struggle most with** and be at highest risk of failing (scoring <7/14)?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Rank the 4 sections by failure risk (1=highest risk, 4=lowest)
2. Which section deserves MORE attention/time?
3. Is listening dangerously under-practiced (0 daily time)?
4. Is grammar over-emphasized relative to productive skills?

**Why It Matters**: Determines if time allocation should be rebalanced to reduce failure risk.

### Q1.3: Are the 332 Anki Cards the True "80/20" High-Value Cards?

**Current Deck Composition**:
- Deck 2.3 (139 cards): Production scaffolds (email openers/closers, opinion markers)
- Deck 2.3.1 (15 cards): Content idea chunks (5 CILS topics)
- Deck 2.4 (29 cards): Verb+preposition collocations
- Deck 3 (60 cards): Thematic vocabulary (10 topics)
- Deck 4 (50 cards): Grammar cloze test format
- Deck 6 (39 cards): Irregular past participles

**The Core Question**:
Are these 332 cards truly the "80/20" optimal set, or is there redundancy/gaps?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Is there redundancy between decks (e.g., same vocab in Decks 3 and 2.3)?
2. Are critical vocabulary items missing?
3. Should Deck 6 (39 past participle cards) be prioritized or deprioritized?
4. Are there grammar concepts tested that aren't in the decks?
5. Total card count: 332 is this right? Too much? Too little?

**Why It Matters**: Identifies wasteful study time and missing coverage.

---

### Q1.4: Which Exam Section is "Highest Leverage" for Passing?

**Leverage Definition**: The section where small improvements in preparation yield the biggest score increases.

**Context**:
- Reading/Grammar (Section B): Objective scoring (cloze test - right/wrong)
- Listening (Section A): Objective (Vero/Falso - right/wrong)
- Writing (Section C): Subjective (teacher grades 14-point rubric)
- Speaking (Section D): Subjective (teacher grades 14-point rubric)

**The Core Question**:
If you could only deeply prepare for **one section**, which would give you the highest probability of passing that section (scoring ≥7/14)?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Which section has highest "prep return on investment"?
2. Grammar/cloze test vs. Speaking subjective grading - which easier to improve?
3. Should the weak/risky sections get emergency attention?

**Why It Matters**: Guides where to focus if time runs short or progress stalls.

## 🔵 TIER 2 QUESTIONS (HIGH PRIORITY - SHOULD ANSWER)

### Q2.1: Are 14 Speaking Prompts & 10 Writing Emails Sufficient?

**Current Practice Plan**:
- **Speaking**: 14 recorded practice prompts (0.5/day over 28 days)
  - Record prompt response
  - Listen to model answer
  - Self-assess fluency/grammar/vocabulary
  - Total time: ~3-4 hours

- **Writing**: 10 timed practice emails (0.35/day over 28 days)
  - Write 80-120 words in 15 minutes
  - Review for grammar/structure
  - Get feedback from model answer
  - Total time: ~4-5 hours

**The Core Question**:
Is this volume of practice sufficient to reach speaking fluency (150-200 words over 2-3 topics) and writing competency (80-120 word email)?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Is 14 speaking prompts enough or should it increase to 28?
2. Is 10 emails enough or should it increase to 20?
3. What's the ideal speaking/writing practice volume for B1?
4. Better to do MORE practice or DEEPER practice on fewer prompts?

**Why It Matters**: Identifies if practice volume is a bottleneck.

### Q2.2: Grammar Coverage - All 6 Tested Categories Covered?

**CILS B1 Grammar Cloze Test** (Section B) typically tests 6 categories:

1. ✅ **Indefinite articles** (un, una, uno, un')
   - Coverage: Deck 4 includes cards on this

2. ✅ **Prepositions** (in, di, a, da, su, per, etc.)
   - Coverage: Deck 2.4 (29 cards) specifically targets this

3. ✅ **Relative pronouns** (che, cui, il quale, etc.)
   - Coverage: Deck 4 includes cards on this

4. ✅ **Pronouns** (direct/indirect objects: lo, la, gli, le, mi, ti, etc.)
   - Coverage: Deck 4 includes cards on this

5. ❓ **Ci/Ne** (partitive and locative pronouns)
   - Coverage: Unclear if Deck 4 covers this adequately

6. ❓ **Verb conjugations & tenses**
   - Coverage: Deck 6 (39 cards) covers IRREGULAR past participles, but what about:
     - Regular verb conjugations?
     - Present tense regular verbs?
     - Future/conditional verb tenses?

**The Core Question**:
Are ALL 6 grammar categories adequately covered by the current decks, or are there gaps?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Which grammar categories are well-covered?
2. Which categories might be weak/undercovered?
3. Should Deck 6 (past participles) be given higher priority?
4. Missing: Present tense regular verbs? Future tense?
5. Suggested grammar drill to fill gaps?

**Why It Matters**: Grammar is highest-leverage section; gaps here mean automatic failures on Section B.

---

### Q2.3: Listening - Is 3 Mock Tests Enough?

**Current Listening Plan**:
- 0 minutes of daily listening practice
- 3 full mock listening tests (45 min each = 2.25 hours total)
- No systematic listening improvement strategy

**Why Listening is Hard**:
- Real-time comprehension (can't re-read like reading section)
- Accents, speed, background noise
- Requires 100+ hours of exposure to master
- Often HARDEST section for non-natives

**The Core Question**:
Is 3 mock tests (2.25 hours of listening prep) sufficient for someone with only A2 listening skills to pass listening (7/14)?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Is 3 mocks enough, or should you do 5-7 mocks?
2. Should daily 10-15 min listening warm-up be added?
3. Best use of these final 28 days for listening improvement?
4. Which listening resource (BBC, news, podcasts) most CILS-aligned?
5. Risk: Is listening going to be the reason you fail?

**Why It Matters**: Listening is often the weak point; under-preparing could tank the exam.

---

### Q2.4: Reading Comprehension - Only 20 Min/Day?

**Current Reading Plan**:
- 20 min/day reading practice
- 10 Percorso unit exercises
- 10+ Vero/Falso comprehension passages
- Total time: ~5-6 hours

**The Core Question**:
Is 20 min/day (17% of study time) sufficient for reading comprehension (Section B Vero/Falso portion)?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Is 20 min/day enough for B1 reading speed/comprehension?
2. Reading is easier than listening to improve - could you reduce this?
3. Or should reading increase?
4. Best practices for reading comprehension at B1?

**Why It Matters**: Identifies if reading is over/under-prepared relative to other sections.

---

### Q2.5: Templates - Are 3 Production Templates Sufficient?

**Current Templates**:
- EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md: 2 email format templates (problem-reporting + information request)
- SPEAKING_TEMPLATE.md: 1 opinion framework (give opinion + reason + example)
- SELF_INTRODUCTION_ORAL.md: 1 personal introduction (115 words)

**The Core Question**:
Are these 3 templates sufficient for writing (email section) and speaking (2-3 topics without preparation)?

**What We Need from Opus**:
1. Should more email template types be added? (complaint, suggestion, apology, etc.)
2. Should speaking template include: description? comparison? advice?
3. Are the templates detailed enough or need more scaffolding?
4. Any template types missing that would significantly help?

**Why It Matters**: Templates are the structural support for fluent production.
