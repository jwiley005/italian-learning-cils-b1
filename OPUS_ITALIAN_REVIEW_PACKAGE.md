- **3 production templates** (Email, speaking, self-introduction)
- **Detailed daily schedule** (2 hours/day structured routine)
- **Success metrics** (Weekly checkpoints and error tracking)

**Key Question for Opus**: Is this 80/20 strategy truly optimized for maximum efficiency in 28 days?

## 📊 SECTION 1: EXAM STRUCTURE & REQUIREMENTS

### The CILS B1 Cittadinanza Exam

**Format**: 4 sections, all must be passed (non-capitalizable)
**Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes total
**Passing Score**: 50% minimum per section (7/14 points)

| Section | Duration | Format | Points | Pass |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|------|
| **A. Ascolto (Listening)** | 20 min | 2 listening tasks: 6 short dialogues + 12 Vero/Falso | 14 | 7 |
| **B. Lettura + Grammatica (Reading + Grammar)** | 40 min | 12 Vero/Falso reading comprehension + 6 cloze grammar gaps | 14 | 7 |
| **C. Produzione Scritta (Writing)** | 25 min | Write 80-120 word email (formal register) | 14 | 7 |
| **D. Produzione Orale (Speaking)** | 15 min | Speak on 2-3 topics without preparation (150-200 words total) | 14 | 7 |

**Critical**: Must score ≥7 points on ALL 4 sections. If you score 13/14 on listening but 4/14 on grammar, you **fail the entire exam** and must retake all 4 sections.

## 🔍 SECTION 4: CRITICAL ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS FOR OPUS

### Q1: Is 28 Days Realistic for B1 Pass?

**Context**:
- Current level: A2 (low-intermediate)
- Target: B1 (intermediate)
- Daily time: 2 hours
- 332 flashcards to memorize
- 4 exam sections to master

**Key Concern**: A2 → B1 is ~200-400 hours of study. Can 2 hours/day × 28 days = 56 hours be enough?

**What Opus Should Assess**:
1. Is 56 hours realistic for this level jump?
2. What's the minimum viable competency for B1 citizenship exam?
3. Should time allocation be adjusted?

---

### Q2: Are the 332 Anki Cards Sufficient & Optimal?

**Current Decks**:
- Deck 2.3 (139 cards): Production scaffolds
- Deck 2.3.1 (15 cards): Content ideas
- Deck 2.4 (29 cards): Prepositions
- Deck 3 (60 cards): Thematic vocabulary
- Deck 4 (50 cards): Grammar cloze
- Deck 6 (39 cards): Past participles

**Questions for Opus**:
1. Are these 332 cards truly the "80/20" high-value cards?
2. Any major gaps in grammar coverage?
3. Any redundancy between decks (wasteful duplication)?
4. Should Deck 6 (past participles) be prioritized or deprioritized?
5. Missing critical vocabulary that would improve exam score?

---

### Q3: Is Time Allocation Optimal Across 4 Sections?

**Current Breakdown** (2 hours/day):
- Grammar exercises: 25 min (20%)
- Reading practice: 20 min (17%)
- Speaking practice: 22 min (18%)
- Writing practice: 25 min (21%)
- Anki review: 25 min (21%)

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Listening** gets 0 minutes daily (only 3 mock tests total)
- **Reading** gets only 20 min (17%)
- **Speaking** gets only 22 min (18%)
- **Writing** gets 25 min (21%)
- **Grammar** focus (via Anki + exercises): 46 min (38%)

**Questions for Opus**:
1. Should listening get MORE daily time (many people struggle with it)?
2. Is grammar over-emphasized (38% of time)?
3. Best allocation to maximize score across all 4 sections?
4. Which section is "highest leverage" for passing?

---

### Q4: Speaking & Writing Practice - Quantity Sufficient?

**Current Plan**:
- **Speaking**: 14 recorded practice prompts over 28 days
  - ~0.5 prompts/day (every other day)
  - Total speaking time: ~3-4 hours

- **Writing**: 10 practice emails over 28 days
  - ~0.35 emails/day (every 3 days)
  - Total writing time: ~4-5 hours

**Concern**: Is this enough practice to reach 150-200 word fluency in speaking or 80-120 word competency in writing?

**Questions for Opus**:
1. Is 14 speaking prompts enough?
2. Is 10 emails enough?
3. Should these increase (double to 28/20)?
4. Best way to structure practice (massed vs. spaced)?

---

### Q5: Grammar Coverage - Are All 6 Tested Categories Covered?

**Grammar Cloze Test** (Section B) typically tests:
1. ✅ Indefinite articles (Deck 4 covers)
2. ✅ Prepositions (Deck 2.4 covers)
3. ✅ Relative pronouns (Deck 4 covers)
4. ✅ Pronouns (direct/indirect objects) (Deck 4 covers)
5. ❓ Ci/Ne (Deck 4 claims to cover, but need verification)
6. ❓ Verb conjugations (Deck 6 covers past participles, but present/future?)

**Questions for Opus**:
1. Are ALL 6 grammar categories adequately covered?
2. Any gaps in verb tense coverage (present, passato prossimo, future)?
3. Should Deck 6 be moved up in priority or deprioritized?
4. Suggestion for additional grammar drill?

---

### Q6: Listening - Only 3 Mock Tests?

**Current Plan**: 3 full mock listening tests (45 min each = 2.25 hours total)

**Concern**:
- Listening is often the hardest section for non-natives
- Only 3 mocks = 3 opportunities to practice
- No daily listening warm-up

**Questions for Opus**:
1. Is 3 mock tests enough for listening?
2. Should daily 10-min listening warm-up be added?
3. What's the minimum viable listening practice?
4. Best resources for CILS B1 listening practice?

---

### Q7: Risk Factors - What Could Cause Failure?

**Critical Failure Points** (Score <7 on one section):

1. **Grammar Section** (Highly likely to fail if unprepared):
   - Need 7/14 = 50% on 6 cloze gaps
   - Current plan: 79 cards targeting grammar
   - Risk level: **LOW** (well-covered)

2. **Reading Section**:
   - Need 7/14 = 50% on 12 Vero/Falso comprehension
   - Current plan: 20 min/day reading + 10 Percorso units
   - Risk level: **MEDIUM** (only 20 min/day, limited practice)

3. **Writing Section**:
   - Need 7/14 = 50% on 80-120 word email
   - Current plan: 2 email templates + 10 practice emails
   - Risk level: **MEDIUM** (10 emails may be insufficient)

4. **Speaking Section**:
   - Need 7/14 = 50% on 150-200 words over 2-3 topics
   - Current plan: 14 recorded prompts + templates
   - Risk level: **MEDIUM-HIGH** (speaking fluency hard to achieve in 28 days)

5. **Listening Section**:
   - Need 7/14 = 50% on 12 Vero/Falso on audio
   - Current plan: Only 3 mock tests (no daily practice)
   - Risk level: **HIGH** (least practiced section, hardest to improve quickly)

**Questions for Opus**:
1. What's the weakest point in this plan (highest failure risk)?
2. Which section should get MORE focus in final 2 weeks?
3. If forced to choose: prioritize speaking or listening?
4. Contingency strategy if listening scores are low during mocks?

---

### Q8: Final 2 Weeks Strategy - How to Peak?

**Days 22-28 (Final Week)**:
- Should you shift to full-length mock exams?
- How many mock exams should you do in final week?
