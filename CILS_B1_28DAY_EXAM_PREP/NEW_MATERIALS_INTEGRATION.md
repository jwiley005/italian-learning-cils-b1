### RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL CHAPTERS (if needed):

**CRITICAL GAPS TO CHECK:**

1. **Ci/Ne particles** (locative/partitive pronouns)
   - Check if covered in Ch 15 (pronouns)
   - If NOT covered: Find the chapter on "Ci and Ne" (typically Ch 18-20 in grammar books)
   - **Action**: Scan this chapter if not in Ch 15

2. **Present tense regular verbs** (-are, -ere, -ire)
   - Check if covered in early chapters (typically Ch 1-5)
   - If NOT covered: Find chapter on "Presente indicativo"
   - **Action**: Scan this chapter if missing (should be in first 5 chapters)

3. **Relative pronouns** (che, cui, il quale)
   - Check if covered in Ch 15 or Ch 17
   - If NOT covered: Find chapter on "Pronomi relativi"
   - **Action**: Scan this chapter if missing (typically Ch 16-18)

### RECOMMENDATION:
1. ✅ Keep all current chapters (13, 14, 15, 17, 23, 33)
2. ⚠️ **VERIFY** Ch 15 covers ci/ne particles
3. ⚠️ **ADD** chapter on present tense if missing (likely Ch 1-5)

**Action**: After Day 1, check these gaps and scan 1-2 additional chapters if needed.
