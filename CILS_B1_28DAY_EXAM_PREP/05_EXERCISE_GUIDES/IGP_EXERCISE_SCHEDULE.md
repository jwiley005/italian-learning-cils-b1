## 📊 TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS

### Create a Simple Log:

| Day | Chapter | Exercises | Time | Errors | Notes |
|-----|---------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Ch 13 | 1-2 | 10 min | 2/20 | Confused lo/la |
| 2 | Ch 13 | 3-4 | 10 min | 1/18 | Better! |
| 3 | Ch 14 | 1-2 | 10 min | 4/22 | A vs. IN still hard |

**Goal**: <10% error rate by Week 3

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO WATCH FOR

### Chapter 13 (Direct Pronouns):
- ❌ Using "lo" for feminine nouns ("la torta" → "lo" is WRONG, should be "la")
- ❌ Forgetting past participle agreement ("le ho mangiate" NOT "le ho mangiato")
- ❌ Apostrophe errors ("l'ho visto" YES, but "li ho visti" NO apostrophe)

### Chapter 14 (Prepositions):
- ❌ "Vado a Italia" (WRONG → "Vado in Italia")
- ❌ "Abito in via Garibaldi" (WRONG → "Abito in via Garibaldi" is CORRECT, but "vivo a Roma" needs "a")
- ❌ Articulated preposition errors ("della casa" vs. "di casa" - depends on article!)

### Chapter 15 (Indirect Pronouns):
- ❌ Using "loro" instead of "gli" for plural ("Do il libro a loro" → informal, use "gli do il libro")
- ❌ Confusing "gli" (to him) and "le" (to her)
- ❌ Double object pronoun order: "glielo" NOT "loglie"

### Chapter 20 (Ci and Ne):
- ❌ Using "ci" with quantities (should be "ne": "ne prendo due" NOT "ci prendo due")
- ❌ Using "ne" for places (should be "ci": "ci vado domani" NOT "ne vado domani")
- ❌ Agreement with past participle: "ne ho comprate tre" (agrees with "tre [torte]")

---

## 🔄 ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL

### After Mock Exam 1 (Day 17):
**If grammar score < 6/14**:
- Add 5 min/day IGP (total 15 min/day)
- Repeat weak chapter exercises from Weeks 1-2
- Focus on highest-error category (pronouns? prepositions?)

### After Mock Exam 2 (Day 20):
**If grammar score still < 7/14**:
- Add 10 min/day IGP (total 20 min/day in Week 4)
- Do ALL exercises from weakest chapter (not just selected ones)
- Consider: grammar is preventing passing → all-in on drills

### If grammar score ≥ 9/14:
- Reduce IGP to 5 min/day
- Reallocate time to listening (highest failure risk)

## 📚 ANSWER KEY USAGE

**IGP Book Answer Keys**: Located at the back of each chapter

**How to Use**:
1. Complete exercise FIRST (don't peek!)
2. Check answers immediately (10 min time limit)
3. Mark errors in red
4. Write error pattern in ERROR_LOG.md
5. If >3 errors in one exercise → redo next day

**Don't**:
- ❌ Look at answers while doing exercise (defeats purpose)
- ❌ Skip exercises because "I know this" (drill = automaticity)
- ❌ Spend >10 minutes per session (diminishing returns)

### Tip 3: Error Log Integration
- Transfer IGP errors to main ERROR_LOG.md
- Look for patterns (e.g., always miss "gli" vs. "le")
- Review error log before mock exams

### Tip 4: Audio Option
- Some IGP exercises have audio (www.almaedizioni.it)
- Use for listening practice (bonus!)
- Not required, but helpful for pronunciation

### Tip 5: Sunday Catch-up
- If you miss a session M-Sat → catch up Sunday
- Don't skip exercises (they're 80/20 selected)
- Consistency > perfection

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem**: "10 minutes isn't enough, I need 20 min per exercise"
**Solution**: You're overthinking. Do faster, check answers, move on. Speed = exam skill.

**Problem**: "I'm making too many errors (>30%)"
**Solution**: Slow down, read questions carefully. If still high errors → need foundation review (but no time, so focus on pattern recognition).

**Problem**: "I don't have the IGP book"
**Solution**: Use Percorso grammar appendix exercises instead (not as targeted, but better than nothing).

**Problem**: "I keep forgetting to do evening IGP"
**Solution**: Set phone reminder (7:00 PM daily). Put book next to dinner plate. Visual cue.
