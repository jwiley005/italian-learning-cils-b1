## 📖 HOW TO USE EACH UNIT (35 min Daily)

### **Listening Practice** (15 min)

**Strategy** (from Percorso p.17):
1. **1st Listen** (no reading!): Just listen, get global meaning
2. **2-min Pause**: Read questions quickly
3. **2nd Listen**: Match audio to answers
4. **2-min Check**: Verify answers
5. **3 min**: Copy to answer sheet (practice for exam!)

**Where to Find Audio**:
- CD included with book (rip to phone/computer)
- Or download from Guerra Edizioni website
- Or use OCR scan + text-to-speech (not ideal but works)

**Important**: Percorso audio = EXACT exam format (speed, accent, structure)

---

### **Reading + Grammar** (20 min)

**Reading Section** (10 min):
- Read entire text FIRST (2 min) - get context
- Answer Vero/Falso questions (6 min)
- Check answer key (2 min)
- **Common Trap**: Info is paraphrased, not word-for-word!

**Grammar Cloze** (10 min):
- Read entire text with gaps (2 min)
- Fill 6 gaps (6 min) - all 3 options = same grammar category!
- Check answer key (2 min)
- **Use your Grammar Cheat Sheet** if stuck!

**Focus**: Don't just get right answer - understand WHY wrong answers are wrong!

## ⚠️ CONTINGENCY PLANS (Based on Mock Exam Scores)

**Listening < 6/14**:
- Double listening practice to 30 min/day
- Repeat Units 1-3 listening sections
- Focus on Vero/Falso strategy (info is paraphrased!)

**Grammar < 6/14**:
- Add 5 min/day IGP drills
- Review Grammar Cheat Sheet daily

**Reading < 6/14**:
- Practice skimming technique (2 min per text)
- Focus on question words (chi, cosa, quando, dove, perché)
- Repeat Units 1-3 reading passages

**Writing < 6/14**:
- Handwrite 1 email/day (not just think about it!)
- Use templates religiously
- Get feedback if possible (native speaker, teacher, or AI)

**Speaking < 6/14**:
- Record yourself daily (not just practice silently!)
- Use opinion framework template
- Increase speaking time to 30 min/day

---

### **If Mock Exam 2 (Day 20) shows no improvement:**

**Emergency Protocol** (Days 21-27):

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Tip 1: Use Percorso as Primary Source**  
This book = designed for YOUR EXACT exam. Every exercise = exam format. Trust it!

**Tip 2: Don't Skip Audio Practice**  
Listening = highest failure risk. Percorso audio = perfect difficulty (not too hard, not too easy).

**Tip 3: Grammar Cloze = Pattern Recognition**  
After doing 10 units + 3 mocks = 13 cloze tests, you'll see patterns. Same grammar categories repeat!

**Tip 4: Production Prompts = Gold**  
Units 6, 8, 10 have EXACT email topics that appear on real exams. Practice these!

**Tip 5: Mock Exams = Calibration, Not Prediction**  
Your mock scores ≠ exam scores. Purpose = identify weak areas and adjust.

---

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem**: "I don't have the Percorso CD/audio files"  
**Solution**: Download from Guerra Edizioni website (usually free with book purchase) or use YouTube "CILS B1 ascolto" practice audios (similar format).

**Problem**: "35 minutes isn't enough for a full unit"  
**Solution**: Spread 1 unit over 2 days. Quality > speed. But don't skip units!

**Problem**: "Mock exam scores are lower than expected"  
**Solution**: Normal! First mock = diagnostic. Focus on improvement, not absolute scores.

**Problem**: "I'm running out of time before the exam"  
**Solution**: Prioritize Mock Exams (Days 17, 20, 23). Skip Units 9-10 if necessary. Mocks = most valuable.
