## 💡 TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE ERROR LOGGING

1. **Be Specific**: Don't just write "grammar error" - specify the exact rule
2. **Track Frequency**: This is the most important data point
3. **Review Weekly**: Every Sunday, analyze patterns from the week
4. **Prioritize 3+ Frequency Errors**: These are your blind spots
5. **Don't Log One-Off Mistakes**: Focus on patterns, not flukes
6. **Use This Before Mock Exams**: Review your error log before Days 17, 20, 23
7. **Update Anki**: If you find a gap, create a new Anki card for it
