**Start Date**: November 6, 2025
**Exam Date**: December 4, 2025 (28 days)
**Daily Commitment**: 2 hours
**Optimization**: Based on Opus strategic review (60-70% pass probability)

## 📊 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**Pass Requirements**: Score ≥7/14 (50%) on ALL 4 sections
- ❌ If you score 13/14 on grammar but 6/14 on listening → FAIL (must retake entire exam)
- ✅ Target: 7-10/14 per section (total 28-40/56)

**Highest Risk Sections** (focus here):
1. 🔴 **Listening** (50% failure risk) → Added 20 min/day
2. 🟠 **Speaking** (35% failure risk) → Increased to 21 prompts
3. 🟡 **Writing** (25% failure risk) → Increased to 15 emails

**Lowest Risk Sections** (don't over-invest):
1. 🟢 **Grammar** (8% failure risk) → Reduced to 30 min/day
2. 🟢 **Reading** (12% failure risk) → Reduced to 15 min/day

## 📝 ERROR LOG PROTOCOL

**Purpose**: Identify patterns, not one-off mistakes

**How to Use**:
1. After each study session, log errors in `06_TRACKING/ERROR_LOG.md`
2. Categorize by type: Grammar, Vocabulary, Listening, Reading, Production
3. Track frequency: If error repeats 3+ times → HIGH PRIORITY for review
4. Review error log before each mock exam

**Example Entry**:
```
Date: Nov 10
Section: Grammar
Error: Used "a la scuola" instead of "alla scuola" (preposition + article)
Correction: Preposition "a" + article "la" → "alla"
Category: Prepositions (articulated prepositions)
Frequency: 3rd time this error
Action: Review Deck 2.4 cards on "a + article"
```

## 💪 MOTIVATION & BURNOUT PREVENTION

**2 Hours/Day for 28 Days = Intense**

**Strategies to Maintain Motivation**:
1. **Visual Progress**: Check off daily tasks, see streaks
2. **Small Wins**: Celebrate Anki milestones (100 cards, 200 cards, etc.)
3. **Rest Days**: Sundays are guilt-free rest (or light catch-up)
4. **Variety**: Alternating speaking/writing keeps it fresh
5. **Mock Exams**: Tangible progress measurement (Days 17, 20, 23)
6. **Accountability**: Share progress with friend/family

**Burnout Warning Signs**:
- Anki retention drops below 70%
- Skipping 2+ days in a row
- Feeling overwhelmed/anxious
- Avoiding production practice

**If Burned Out**:
- Take 1 full rest day (no study)
- Reduce daily time to 90 min for 2-3 days
- Focus only on Anki + listening (easiest tasks)
- Resume full schedule when energy returns

---

## 🚀 FINAL THOUGHTS

- ✅ Optimized study plan (60-70% pass probability)
- ✅ 347 high-value Anki cards
- ✅ Production templates

2. **Listening Priority**: 20 min/day (reduces failure risk by 20%)
3. **Mock Exams**: Days 17, 20, 23 (critical calibration points)
4. **Error Log**: Track patterns, not one-off mistakes
5. **Templates**: Internalize until no reference needed
